-> Scrolling and scaling the playing area work, but we put limitations on
   scrolling and scaling so that the user can't scroll the playing area off
   the screen and can't scale the playing area smaller than the screen size.
-> The valve always rotates when a player selects 'Open Valve' but the gauge line
   will only increase to full if the player's pipeline has no leaks AND they have
   pressed the "Open Valve" button.
		* Also, since the End Game screen appears quickly after pressing
		  "Open Valve", it can be hard to notice that the handle or gauge line
		  has changed unless you're looking specifically for those changes.
